    [Password Generator](https://www.zoho.com/vault/password-generator.html)
   
    [Nord Pass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) (for common password list specifically in India)
2. Tested each one using an online strength checker like:
   
     [passwordmeter.com](http://www.passwordmeter.com/)
   
     [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/)
3. Collected and documented the results and feedback.
4. Noted down best practices for creating secure passwords.
5. Researched common password attacks such as:
   - Brute force
   - Dictionary attack
6. Summarized how password complexity and length improve security.
