## Tips for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns
- Never reuse old passwords
- Use passphrases
  
## Common Password Attacks -

- **Brute Force:** Trying all possible combinations
  - An attacker uses a tool like **Hydra**
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using common word lists to guess passwords
  - An attacker loads a list of commonly used passwords into a cracking tool like **John the Ripper**
- **Credential Stuffing:** Reusing leaked username-password pairs
  - An attacker takes leaked credentials from a data breach
 
## Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity significantly increases the security of user accounts and systems. Here's how:

1. Harder to Guess:
 - Complex passwords use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, making them harder for attackers to guess.

2. Increases Brute Force Time:
 - Each added character and variation exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, slowing down brute-force attacks.

3. Resists Dictionary Attacks:
 - Dictionary attacks rely on common words and patterns. Complex, unpredictable passwords fall outside these lists.

4. Higher Entropy = Stronger Passwords:
 - Entropy measures unpredictability. Complex passwords have higher entropy, making them more secure.

5. Passphrases Improve Usability and Security:
 - Long but memorable passphrases (e.g., `Yellow_Tiger^Runs7Fast`) offer both strength and recall.
